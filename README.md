<h1>Overview</h1>
I had a thought one day that my vocabulary wasn't very great, and since I'm a computer science major I made a python script to help.

It gets a random word and its dictionary definition from webster dictionary's API, and prints the word and definition to the console. 

some api practice in python too.

<h1>Chat GPT Implementation</h1>

I was curious how chatGPT would make the app, so i asked it to and it did - in 5 minutes (with minimal help).

<h1>To Use Yourself</h1>
In order to use this you'd need your own Webster API key. See how at <a href='https://dictionaryapi.com'>webster's official documentation</a>.
Run either python file to output a random word from a dictionary and its werriam-webster definition.
