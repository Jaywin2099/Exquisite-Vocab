Had a thought to make my vocabulary better so i made a quick script to get a random word and its dictionary definition. 

some api practice in python too.

also i was curious how chatGPT would make the app, so i asked it to and it didn in 5 minutes with a little pushing.

run either python file to output a random word from a dictionary and its werriam-webster definition.
